## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive design

### What I learned

I got pretty much more familiar with flexbox. I learned that I still need some practice, but it's quite helpful for organizing groups of elements. I love how it works.

Something I hadn't worked with, until now, is google fonts. I used Lexend Deca and Inter, as proposed in the style guide.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Inter|Lexend+Deca">
```

Additionally... the ability to create a responsive mobile version depending on the size width.

```css
@media screen and (max-width: 500px)
}
```

### Continued development

I'm still kind of new, as of right now. But I feel great after working a couple houes through this challenge. I'm learning HTML, CSS and JS. Any comments on this work are greatly well received.
